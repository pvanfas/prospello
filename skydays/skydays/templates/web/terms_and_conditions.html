                                            road works may necessitate route changes in the itineraries, Indian

                                            away from the city centre. Most of the rooms have private bath or shower.
                                            The hotels
                                            will either be those shown in the itinerary or of the same category. Due to

                                            fairs and conventions in the cities the hotels may be blocked out for more

                                            yrs in advance. In view of this you may have to stay in hotels further away

                                            cities and itineraries may have to be altered / amended. Since the rooms are
                                            comparatively small, we would recommend only 3 persons in one room for your

                                            comfort. Triple rooms are usually no larger than twin rooms and the third

                                            and from destination to destination. The baggage restrictions could also
                                            vary for
                                            different classes of travel. For flights where baggage is not included, an

                                            correct details. We are not liable, in any manner, if you are unable to
                                            carry any
                                            baggage or if you have to pay any extra-charges due to restrictions imposed
                                            by the
                                            airline. You shall be liable to pay all such charges directly to the

                                            regulations regarding the weight restrictions and furthermore, airlines keep
                                            changing the rules quite frequently. Hence, you are requested to please
